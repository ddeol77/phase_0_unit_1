# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
<br>My biggest time management challenge will be making time with a full-time job and a wife and two kids.  This is not an excuse I know a lot of the other cohorts have other committments as well.
* How will you combat that? 
<br>Well my plan was to try and sneak out to starbucks at lunch and work on it at night when the kids go to bed.  Unfortunately that plan has not worked and I've had to employ different strategies.  I've decided to use a vacation day once a week for the rest of phase 0 in order to get more done.
* What techniques will you try?
<br>Aside from taking a day off from work I found that going to my local library has helped me concentrate and be productive.  I've also made sure to let my wife and family know I don't have time for any additional committments this summer so no more vacations or trips until I get a job as a software developer!
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
<br>My overall plan is to make this a priority, ask for help if needed, and try not to procrastinate.
