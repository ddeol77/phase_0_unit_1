# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
	*The Document Object Model is a layer that sits on top of the html and css that interacts with Javascript to make the pages dynamic.  It makes sense that presenting the webpage as a document would allow javascript to easily find the elements on the page to modify them.  It seems like an efficient way make a page dynamic.
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
	My site had a lot more images and objects to load.  The wordpress site was mostly text so there was not as much  that needed to be pulled from the server.
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
	I found it to be fun and helpful to work with.
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
	Opening the network tab and seeing everything that was being loaded on the page and their detailed info was an aha moment for me.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
