# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://ddeol77.github.io/index.html

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
<br>-I learned that there are so many different ways to approach design and user experience and so many opinions out there.  You need to take the time to make sure the design and experience you apply is of your own style and taste.
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
<br>-I like design and user experience.  It was a lot of fun working on all aspects of my site.  I could keep working on it and improving it for hours.
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
<br>-My process was to spend some time reading about design, look at pages online to see what format I liked, and then try and create the wireframe based off that.  For me referencing previous reading material helped me find solutions when I got stuck.  Going online didn't work because there are so many opinions about design and what good/bad etc.
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
<br>-I really need to spend some more time and my styling and positioning.  I'm not happy with the quality of it right now.
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
<br>-I needed to reference the reading material but once I did I thought it was easy to apply.  I think the twitter bootstrap framework is very cool but I know we are not supposed to use any frameworks until we know how they work.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
<br>-I found some useful tutorials online for positioning but mostly used the articles referenced in our materials.
