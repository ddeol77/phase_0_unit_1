# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
<br> I think web standards are a good practice.  It makes it easy for developers to understand the components of a page, how it is layed out, and makes it easy for a new person to maintain.
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
<br> The standard structure makes sense.  It is layed out in a logical format with styling references at the top, headers, and then a footer section at the bottom.
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
<br> I do like the new HtML5 elements.  I like the fact that the tags now have semantic names that give more description about the content inside their tags.  It allows a developer to understand the components of a page much quicker.
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
<br> reset.css allows your styling to look the same on all the different browsers.  Different browsers and versions have different 'default' styling that they apply to pages.  By resetting the css first you always have the same starting point regardless of what browser you page is viewed in.
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
<br> I've used chrome, safari,firefox, and Internet Explorer.  Yes sites definitely look different in different browsers.  Especially in the multiple versions of IE.  I think it's bad because the end result will be different than what the web developer intended for the page to look like.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
<br> I couldn't find any information on how to apply css to a semantic HTML5 tag so I called a friend who is a developer (I hope thats ok!).  He explained to me that it works the same way as when you apply css to 'body'.  There is no '.' or '#' since it's not a class or an id.
