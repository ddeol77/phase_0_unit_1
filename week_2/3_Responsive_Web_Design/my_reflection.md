# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
<br>-Responsive web design is creating web applications that adapt to the screen sizes and resolutions different users have.   I like it because it allows you to increase the size of your audience by making software that adapts to different devices and their resolutions.  I think it is a very good practice.  Like the articles said users may access the web from several different types of devices and this allows the software to be viewed across mulitple devices.

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
<br>-Smartphones and tablets have changed web design by making developers have to account for them in their designs.  Now when a site is designed those devices are accounted for in the process.  I think new technology will make software more and more portable and accessed by everyday devices(Internet of things). This will definitely change web design and force designers towards simplicity and interaction that is straight-forward and simple.
<br>
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
<br>-Visually impaired people use the web with screen readers.  Yes they can use the web and we should make sure they can!  We definitely should design and develop for them!
<br>
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
<br>-The media queries technique is a good way to make the pages dynamic and they way they work resonates with me.  Pretty much everything covered made sense.
