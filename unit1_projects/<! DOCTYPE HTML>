            <h2>Why is pair programming important?</h2> Developers on professional teams pair program often because it helps them with test-driven 
            development. Pair programing helps peers catch each others'' errors and mistakes, in addition to helping teams brainstorm on solutions more efficiently.

            <h2>Difference between Driver and Navigator</h2> Navigator is usually a litle more knowledgable, possibly mroe senior, and guides 
            the driver while the driver pushes the gas, the navigator tells them where to steer with the code. Its also helpful for pairs 
            to be able to switch back and forth when solving complex problems.
