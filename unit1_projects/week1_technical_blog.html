			<a href="http://www.teslamotors.com" target="_blank">1. Tesla Motors</a>

			<p>This is one of my favorite sites because well Tesla Motors is my favorite company, the Tesla Model S is my favorite car, and the design of their site is fantastic.</p>

			<p>When you look at the site the first thing you'll notice is a large picture of the beautiful Tesla Model S.  Since that is the what the company is selling it is definitely the most important area of the landing page.  The overall theme of the site is simplicity and ease of use.  There is no clutter like some other sites and the user is presented with just the right amount of information on each page</p>

			<p>The purpose of the site is to sell luxury electric cars.  The user can order a car from the site or make a reservation for one of their upcoming vehicles.</p>

			<p>5 words that describe this site are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>simple</li>
					<li>effective</li>
					<li>beautiful</li>
					<li>dynamic</li>
					<li>luxurious</li>
