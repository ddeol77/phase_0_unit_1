		<h1>Here are 3 of My <span class="accent">Favorite</span> Websites<h1>

		<h2>
			1.<a href="http://www.teslamotors.com" target="_blank">Tesla Motors</a>

			<p>This is one of my favorite sites because well Tesla Motors is my favorite company, the Tesla Model S is my favorite car, and Elon Musk is my favorite CEO.</p>

			<p>When you look at the site the first thing you'll notice is a large picture of the beautiful Tesla Model S.  Since that is the what the company is selling it is definitely the most important area of the landing page.  The overall theme of the site is simplicity and ease of use.  There is no clutter like some other sites and the user is presented with just the right amount of information on each page.</p>

			<p>The purpose of the site is to sell luxury electric cars and provide information about electric cars in general.  Some of the topic are at home charging, the national supercharger network, and the lack of maintenance.  The user can order a car from the site or make a reservation for one of their upcoming vehicles.</p>

			<p>5 words that describe this site are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>simple</li>
					<li>effective</li>
					<li>beautiful</li>
					<li>dynamic</li>
					<li>luxurious</li>
				</ul>

		<h2>
			2.<a href="http://www.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon</a>

			<p>Amazon is the site I buy almost everything from.  Amazon has made my life easier by allowing me to get almost everything I need from one place.  The amount of reviews on so many products makes it easier to decide on products to buy.</p>

			<p>When you look at the home page the first thing you'll see the the ad for Amazon's kindle fire.  If you take a step back though you'll see categories for shopping and lots of other options.  This site gives the user a ton of information but it is organized and sorted in a way that it's manageable and not overwhelming.</p>

			<p>The purpose of the site is to allow users to purchase items, provide reviews, read reviews, and put items into a wish list.  The user has hundreds of categories of items they can choose from and read reviews on.</p>

			<p>5 words that describe this site are:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>informative</li>
					<li>organized</li>
					<li>useful</li>
					<li>simple</li>
					<li>fast</li>
