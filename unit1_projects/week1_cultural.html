			<p>I'm looking forward to starting the on-site portion of the course and work with the other campers in project teams. After working on the assignments for the first week I can see that this will be a challenging but rewarding journey.</p>

			<p>The fact that he said this is all an experiment freaked me out a little bit initially.  But the truth is that the experiment has been working so it's not like we are all going into an unproven program.</p>

			<p>Even though I'm sure this will be stressful and exhausting at times I'm looking forward to this experience.  I believe that when I look back I will be thankful that I challenged myself and was a part of this program.
