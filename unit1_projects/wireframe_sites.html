		<h2>Tesla Motors</h2>

		<img height="300px" width="300px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddeol77/ddeol77.github.io/master/unit1_projects/images/Screen%20Shot%202014-05-20%20at%206.35.57%20PM.png"></a>

		<p>The problem this web page is solving is that not enough people know about this company and they need a way to be able to buy their cars</p>
		<p>The visual challenges are being able to display as much information about the company and its product on the landing page without making it look busy and cluttered</p>

		<h2>Amazon</h2>

		<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddeol77/ddeol77.github.io/master/unit1_projects/images/Screen%20Shot%202014-05-20%20at%206.46.44%20PM.png"></a>

		<p>The problem Amazon's site is solving is that users have different shopping habits and the homepage is trying to cater products to each user</p>
		<p>The visual challenge here is also trying to display a clean layout but yet at the same time maximize sales with as many applicable product choices as possible</p>

		<h2>MSN</h2>

		<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddeol77/ddeol77.github.io/master/unit1_projects/images/Screen%20Shot%202014-05-20%20at%207.01.46%20PM.png"></a>

		<p>The problem MSN's site is trying to solve is the people don't have a central location for all of their information and the information they do see is not customized for them.</p>
		<p>The visual challenge here is similar to the others where they don't want to bombard the user with information but yet be able to have one page with all the information the user would need.</p>
