## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add
Takes files and gets them ready to be comitted to the repsitory.  Add creates a list 
of files that will be comitted.

#### branch
This will take a copy of the master source code that will be exclusively for you to work on.  It will
have a different name and be independent of the master branch.  Kind of like a branch on a tree.

#### checkout
Allows you to move to a repository that you want to check.  

#### clone
Makes a copy (clone) of a respository to a directory that you create

#### commit
Takes the changes that were made to a repository that you specify.  A message alongside it describing
what you are comitting is usually required.

#### fetch
Downloads the contents of another repository to a location that you specify.

#### log
Displays all the logs of the commits that have taken place.

#### merge
Takes all the changes that you've made to your personal branch and merges them with the master branch.

#### pull
Literally pulls the latest changes from Github to your local repository.

#### push
Takes your local changes and pushes all your commits online to Github.

#### reset
This command will allow the user to go back to an earlier version of the repository if they realize that
they did not want to make a certain commit.

#### rm
If you want to remove files from a git repository you use the rm command.  If you go into a folder and delete a
file git will think that it is missing so the rm command should be used instead.

#### status
This will give you information about a repository.  It will tell you things like which branch of the repository
you're working on, which files are inside it, and the changes that still need to be committed.

## Release 4: Git Workflow

- Push files to a remote repository: git add, git commit -"message", git push - This will bring the files to git's
attention, record the changes made to the repository files, and update the remote repository with the comitting changes 
in your local repository.

- Fetch changes: git remote -v, git fetch - The first command will give you the location of the remote repository 
and then you use the second command on that location to get all the contents

- Commit locally: git add, git commit -m"" - You will add files to git's attemtion and take the changes that were made
with a message describing what is in the commit.

## Release 5: Errors you encountered
1. Error
2. Solution
3. Cause (explain the error)
I did not have any errors to describe in this section

## Release 6: Reflection
1. What worked was actually performing the commands on the terminal and seeing the results.  That helped me understand them.
I had a hard time understanding the difference between commit and push initially.  It makes sense now.
2. I had a question on the definition of a few of the commands.  I used the reading material citing and the gitref.org site
for more information.
3. The concept I had the most trouble with was the difference between commit and push.  I realized the comitting is deciding 
what changes you are going to push and push is then actually pushing them to the remote repository.
4. I learned some new git commands for the terminal.
5. I'm very confident in using git commands in the terminal, I'm very confident in fetching chanes from a forked repository, and
I'm also confident in pushing and pulling changes betwen my local and remote repositories.
