## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

First you need to go to github.com and create an accout if you don't already have one.  Click on 'create repository' and enter the name/path of the repository with your username in the path.  I'm using linux so for ubuntu you tell Github you want to copy the repository you created online to your local machine using command line.

Open source is software that allows anyone access to it's source code.  This allows people to make free copies, modify, and depending on the license even sell versions of it.

I think open source allows you to pool the knowledge of a much larger community of developers to create a product.  I think that will allow for much better software than a small private software team at a company.  Open source feels like utopia to me.  I love free software!

Licenses are important for declaring the degree of restriction the creator of the software is allowing and also to give the creator credit.

The concept of using version control by creating a local copy of a repository from Github was solidified by actually creating the copy locally.  I did struggle with copying over the version into ubunty initially but after some additional steps with SSH keys I was able to create the copy.

I used help links in the github site to gain access to SSH articles.  This allowed me to configure my SSH keys so I could create a local copy of the github repository.
