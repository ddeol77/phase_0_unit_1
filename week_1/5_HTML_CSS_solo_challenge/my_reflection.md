Questions I had during this challenge were around the sytax details needed for the correct CSS.  I went online and looked at tutorials as well as the additional links that were provided in github.

It took me some time to understand the absolute and relative positioning.  After trial and error I was able to get the correct result.

Yes I learned a lot of new CSS and HTML.

I am moderately confident of my abilities with this section.

I enjoyed applying styling elements to tags with CSS.

I found all the positioning commands tedious.
