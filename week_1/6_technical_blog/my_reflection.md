Blog url: http://ddeol77.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I think this assignment made me look at websites in a different way.  I now look at the design and usability of a website more than just its use.  I enjoyed creating this blog page.  It was fun to play around with the different styles and layout.  I feel good about creating basic html and css.
