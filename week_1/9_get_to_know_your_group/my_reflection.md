Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

It made me feel better that other cohorts have are also nervous about taking this challenge. This week I was a bit overwhelmend but after completing all the challenges I feel even more confident about my ability to rise to these challenges.  I feel good and am ready to take on the next set of challenges.
