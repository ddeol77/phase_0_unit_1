## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
*    
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience.
* 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
*   
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
*  
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

My biggest struggle was sorting through all the different documents and information.  I learned that being patient
helped me organize all the information presented to me.

A good example from one of the articles is that git is like a flashdrive you store pictures on and Github is like dropbox.
So git is a local version control and GitHub is an online could-based version control where you can share, push changes, and access
them remotely.

Version control is a system that allows you to track changes to files and save a history of different versions.  GitHub uses
version control to allow multiple people to work on a project/file without losing everyone's changes and merging all their work
together into one master file.

Developers use version control so they can revert back to previous versions if they make a mistake (bug), if they are 
investigating a bug they can look back to previous versions and potentially find the cause of the bug, it allows multiple
developers to work on a project together without losing their individual work, and merges all of their work into one master file.
It makes perfect sense to me.  Using version control is the best way to do software development both for an individual or a group

All the information about git, github, and version control in general make sense.  These are tools that allow software development
to take place in an organized and effective manner.
